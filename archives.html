                                <p>This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish on Sharon Creek Reservoir. A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of rain to cool us off. Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as well as some bruiser carp.</p>
                                <p>Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass.</p>

                                <p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.</p>
                                <p>They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it. This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank side damage and erosion.</p>

                                <p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd. Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.</p>
                                <p>At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side.It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof! It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time.</p>

                                <p>While a good amount of trash was removed from the area, participants commented that there seemed to be significantly less to pick up than in previous years. Let's hope that trend continues!</p>
